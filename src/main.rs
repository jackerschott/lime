    //      because its cheap; processing an image is expensive)

    // 4. execute parsing result
    // 4.1 when a function is called, extract function name, arguments
    //      and apply appropriate rust routine
    // 4.2 when a variable is assigned, evaluate right hand side expression and
    //      store result in some lookup table (definitely needed for layers as in
    //      e.g. Photoshop)
    // 4.3 ignore interactive calls for now
    // 4.4 opening and closing images are simply handled as functions
